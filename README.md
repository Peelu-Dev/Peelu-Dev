## 🧠 About Me

I’m an aspiring neuroscientist and interdisciplinary researcher with a unique blend of skills in **clinical psychology**, **bio-signal processing**, and **computer science**. My journey began in software and IoT development and took a decisive turn toward neuroscience after my personal experience with Trigeminal Neuralgia. Today, I explore **pain perception**, **decision-making**, **attention**, and **affective neuroscience topics** using tools like **EEG**, **ERP**, **GSR**, **gaze allocation**, **pupil dilation** and **behavioral experiments**.
